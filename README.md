# How to run
* Editor) Download/clone the repo and open the root in Unity 2020.3.0f1.
* WebGL) A WebGL build is live on GitHub Pages - see the running environments from the main page of the repository to access it.
* Standalone) Download/clone the repository and the latest Standalone build can be found & run from the "Build" folder in the root of the repository.

# Controls
* Controls are on-screen in the application.
* Alt-F4 to exit if you're using the Standalone app.

# Note
* There is a secret feature that does not function in the WebGL build, but this does not interfere with the project itself. If you'd like a surprise, run the Standalone version. The function doesn't work in WebGL simply due to web hosting/pricing/etc. - it's not a big deal to fix if one had access to an AWS/GCP/Azure account.
